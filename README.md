## 📖 Overview
The course **CSA1414 - Compiler Design for Hardware Synthesis** provides a comprehensive understanding of **compiler construction techniques** tailored for **hardware synthesis**.  
By applying compiler principles (lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation) in the context of **HDLs (VHDL/Verilog)**, students learn to implement automated flows for **high-level language → hardware mapping**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand **fundamentals of compiler design** with focus on **hardware synthesis**.  
- Explore **translation techniques** for mapping **high-level languages to HDLs**.  
- Implement compiler components such as:  
  - **Lexical Analyzers**  
  - **Parsers**  
  - **Semantic Analyzers**  
  - **Code Generators**  
- Gain **hands-on experience** via lab experiments, assignments, and project-based activities.  
- Develop skills to connect **theory** with **practical hardware synthesis workflows**.
